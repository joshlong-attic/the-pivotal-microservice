## Outline #1

NOTE: the following is my first attempt at jottin down the ideas I want to introduce or explore in this post.

- What Are Microservices?
 * Adiran Cochroft put it best: SOA with a bounded context.
 * Martin Fowler talks about them in his http://martinfowler.org/[bliki].
 * theyre a cultural change as much as a technological change.

-  Why Microservices / Motivations
 * why do we build applications today? We build them to serve users.
 * Those users demand new features more often && the market's fickle. can't afford to waste time in getting to market. time-to-value. boardroom agility to technology agility.
 * there's an increasingly large amount od data, as well! (social, mobile, IoT, etc.)
 * check out Matt S's talk the "mutualistic symbiosis" which I think lays the motivations for microservices down adeptly.
 * microservices are also a technology win
 * they help build loosely coupled systems: components are isolated from each other. Small, agile teams cna build singly focused, isolated services.
 * small singly-focused services can be developed by different teams. Released by different teams.
 * the things that are known about MS include:
  ** lots of singly focused services
  ** smart services, dumb pipes - often REST but could conceivably be AMQP or osme other ubiquitous, easily consumed protocol  (point is, it doesnt matter, but try not to use SOAP or CORBA, k?)
  ** there are patterns that emerge when trying to build htese small services in a larger system.

- The Emergent Patterns of Microservices
 * *api gateway* -  what happens when u start breaking all these services into little silos? it can be important to get a birds-eye view perspective of the data. the api gateway pattern helps w/ this. (Zuul Proxy )
 * *service discovery* - routing should be done on the cleint-side. This lets the application take whatever action is necessary according to its own rules.  (Netflix  Eurekas)
 * *distributed, versioned, refreshable configuration management* -
    configuration  is ubiquitous. it's important to be able to change it in a central place and have services see the changes as needed on the fly. to promote resilience, it is helpful to support refreshable configuration.
 * *circuit-breaker* or *bulkheads* are but a few of the patterns that seek to create systems that are resilient to failure. (hystrix)
 * some patterns cconcern themselves specifically w/ the book keeeping of clsuter state. things like leadership election, etc. Spring Cloud Zookeeper support.

- the *agile* microservice
  * *production readiness* is key.  Tom Poppendieck states (see quote [1]), production readiness is important. if u've ever read _Release It!_ teh punchline is _production ready != code complete_. Spring boot ships w/ a lot of that by default.
  * smaller services make it easier to deliver MVP (minimum viable product) code quickly, doing the simplest thng that could possibly work.
  * the smaller the microserivce, the more readily a developer can get it to production. the faster it's in production, the faster it can deliver value which can then trigger new demands. etc. this is a vrituous cycle very much in keeping w/ agile.
  * a microservice is part of a larger system. that larger system (by definitino) has lots of moving parts. its critical to remove the inherent complexity of those moving parts. Uncle Bob stupidly make the assertion that this complexity is overwhelming if u involve rest, and network hops. i disagree. look how simple a simple Spring Boot rest service can be. look at all the benefits u get in exchange. indeed, even in JAVA a simple REST service can be a 5 liner.

- the reproducibly built microservice
  * IT DOES, however, get complicated in managing all those moving parts. A PaaS can help here in a big way. Building services that comply w/ the 12-factor approach is easy w/ Boot, and doing so can realize MANY benefits, including the ability to scale cheaply and to build systems that are resistant to failure.
  * Boot makes configuration dead simple. It normalizes all inputs for configuration (environment variables, command line switches, property files or yaml files, etc) into SPring's `Environment`. This means that consuming process bound configuration like service configuration or consuming property values in a property file are the same thing. The choice is yours to make on which is more suited to your use case.
  * Sometimes, we can't be purely 12-factor compliant. Sometimes we need some state. PaaSes hate that. Spring Session.
  * PaaSes like Cloud Foundry, Heroku, Google App Engine, Open Shift, make it eaiy to describe and deploy complex systems. A PaaS == a service platform. See also the quote about removing the operatinos burden by letting the paas do it. devs dont need to be janitors for the buildings they architect aby longer. this doesn't remove the need for operations, but it empowers developers to handle what thye need. each team can now own the entire vertical: design, dev, delivery. Operations can focus onw hat they care about - security, capacity, etc. - and devs can make great software.


 - the secure microservice
  * it becomes doubly important int he world of mobile, html5 and iot-facing services to keep ur services safe. otoh, u don't want to duplicate this logic at every node. Spring Security OAuth ( `@EnableSso2`)   makes it trivial to build a clsuter-wide sso stack.
  * CF makes it trivial to expose everything through SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks between services and their out-in-thw-wild clients.

- the data centric microservice.
 * after all, thats the name oft he game right? Services w/o data would be pointless!
 * build a singly focused service. let it work with one domain. this frees u to choose the _right_ datastore for the job. it lets you work w/ the right service for the job. DONT stick everything, compatible or not, into an Oracle. NOSQL && Hadoop ftw. Additionally, NoSQL stores can _give_ you extra fucntionalut that would be hard to duplicate using Oracle. For example: it's trivial to build a recommendation engine using Neo4j. It's trivial to build GIS aware queries using MongoDB. It's trivial to build a full-text search using ElasticSearch or SOLR. (which boot supports abley!)
 * PaaSes like CF make this choice even sweeter because they manage the infrastructure itself. Its cheap to experiemtn, to build atop a PaaS. Devs dont need to worry about getting everything setup in their local environment. they can experiement. they can build out what they wanted.
 * In fact, if u take it a bit further: microservices are often just faces||facades around data. It doesn't matter how those faces re created. It can be dead simple tos tandup a REST service that acts as a repository to a backend datastore.
 * if the result is something to be derived, you've got a simple question to answer: online or offline?  these days, there's enough hard disk space and ram to keep everything. the questino is: what do you do w/ it once youve got it?  Spring Batch can easily handle processing chores for large, sequential-data based batches. When the data's big enough, it's a natural evolution to move to Hadoop && Pivotal HD as an ideal data fabric for computing large batch sets.
 * not all data is batch-centric. Indeed, with the internet of things, mobile, and social driving usage, we're seeing a lot of data that just goes 24/7. for those use cases, online stream-based procesing is ideal. Spring XD is a natural vehicle for standing up online data processing pipelines. You can drive them usnig a regular old Boot microservice.

## Outline # 2

- broadly, microservice is..
 * Adiran Cochroft put it best: SOA with a bounded context.
 * Martin Fowler talks about them in his http://martinfowler.org/[bliki].
 * theyre a cultural change as much as a technological change.
 * why do we build applications today? We build them to serve users.
 * Those users demand new features more often && the market's fickle. can't afford to waste time in getting to market. time-to-value. boardroom agility to technology agility.
 * there's an increasingly large amount od data, as well! (social, mobile, IoT, etc.)
 * check out Matt S's talk the "mutualistic symbiosis" which I think lays the motivations for microservices down adeptly.
 * microservices are also a technology win
 * they help build loosely coupled systems: components are isolated from each other. Small, agile teams cna build singly focused, isolated services.
 * small singly-focused services can be developed by different teams. Released by different teams.
 * the things that are known about MS include:
  ** lots of singly focused services
  ** smart services, dumb pipes - often REST but could conceivably be AMQP or osme other ubiquitous, easily consumed protocol  (point is, it doesnt matter, but try not to use SOAP or CORBA, k?)
  ** there are patterns that emerge when trying to build htese small services in a larger system.

- a _Pivotal_ microservice is..
 * easy to get up and running w/ Spring Boot
 * easy to integrate with, be it over REST or AMQP (Spring Boot, Integration)
 * agile
 * secure
 * part of a larger cluster that requires special care (see emergent patterns of microservices)
 * reproducible
 * data-driven


## Outline 3: the 12 Factor Application
 - codebase
 - dependencies
 - configuration
 - backing services
 - build, release, run
 - processes
 - port binding
 - concurrency
 - dev/production parity
 - logs
 - administrative processes


## Outline 4: the Pivotal Microservice

- are easy to build (12f: dependencies, mvn, 12f: dev/prod parity,)
- portable (env vars, written to a higher level stack like posix, cf, etc., uses common open technologies wherever possible)
- transparent configuration
- data-driven: embraces data. the line between a data store and a data processing engine is increasingly blurred. whats to say a Spring XD solution isn't a microservice?
- are ephemeral, stateless processes (sticky sessions are a no/no; Spring Session; see 12:backing services)
- light, resilient to failure, death (they should be easy to start, kill, at a moments notice); theyre quick to start, stop. can die  at a moments notice; no long running HTTP svcs. u can stop listening to http and refuse incoming requests; netflix chaos monkey; choregraphy vs orchestration (eg, react to failure per service)
- consumes services in a consistant way (no diff between 3rd party or app specific services: to CF everythng's a attached service. Spring's config makes it consistent.)
- looks the same in prod, dev, etc. uses build, release (build + config), and run stages (biuld + config + runtime) to keep the apps decoupled from build. u want to reduce the moving parts for the build phase to as few steps as possible.
- scalable: (see 12f: concurrency)
