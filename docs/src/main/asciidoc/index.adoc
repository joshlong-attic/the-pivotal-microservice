At Pivotal, we're building the best platform for today's workloads. One architecture style in particular - _microservices_ - seems to best capture what is typical, and best, in a lot of the applications we've seen deployed on our platform and with our technology.

Though our company is new (launched April 2013), we owe our rich heritage to the foundational groups and technologies (Spring, Cloud Foundry, Pivotal Labs, RabbitMQ, Redis, our Apache Tomcat leadership, Greenplum, Gemfire, our Groovy-language leadership, etc.) that launched Pivotal. All of these technologies followed their own trajectories to arrive here, at a time where our customers are building radically different applications  than those of even 10 years ago.

## How Did We Get Here?
### Scale
The need for scale has changed the dynamics and economics of a modern applications and application architectures. We all know that Moore's law - named for Intel founder Gordon Moore - has not really been a law since the early 2000s when it became more cost effective to add more CPUs than to scale an individual CPU on a chip. To do more, applications would need to become more concurrent, to scale out. CSC claims that data-production will be 44000% larger in 2020 than 2009.

**Mobile technology** brought computers home. Many developing nations skipped terrestrial  telephony infrastructure altogether and instead went straight to mobile devices. When the era of the smart phone began in earnest with the iPhone (and Android soon thereafter), much of the world - not just the superpowers that had more ubiquitous access to computing infrastructure - ushered it in. This created a net-centric platform with access to untold millions (and billions) more that simply didn't exist before. Google's Larry Page said in 2012 that  http://www.androidcentral.com/larry-page-15-million-android-devices-activated-every-day[Google was seeing 15 million new Android devices activated] _every day_! iPhone activations tend to trend much further behind, but represent  a staggering amount in any event, and taken together they represent a platform (and market opportunity) that modern application developers would be foolish to ignore.

The **Internet-of-Things** is the logical extension of this growth. It is the idea that computing is immersive and pervasive - a part of the everyday experience. We're already seeing it. The roads in Singapore, a small city-state in Asia, are connected via censors to a smart grid that helps operators understand (and optimize for) traffic patterns. You can buy refridgerators that are connected to the internet and that buy and sell their own power on the commodities markets!  The United Nations claims that by 2018, Earth will be home to 7.6 billion people and - by contrast - http://www.businessinsider.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet-of-things-2013-3?op=1#ixzz3FxCafwWe[there will be some 25 billion connected devices by 2015, and 50 billion by 2020, says Cisco, a maker of networking devices]. Of course, NATS and IPv6 are reactions to this growth. After all, if you beleive Cisco, there'll be an average of more than 3 connected devices per person by 2015. This trend seems likely to increase with wearable computing (Google Glass, Apple iWatch, etc.), too. I won't even tell you how many devices I have on my person on a given day!

**Social platforms** have also driven scale. The diagram below (from 2012) gives a good perspective on the insane scale of most social platforms, like Facebook. Empires (anybody remember Farmville?) have been built and destroyed on the strength of piggybacking on these social platforms alone.

### Agility
It's hard to know whether scale begat agility, or the other way around! Either way,  the marketplace _pivots_ (pardon me) on a dime today and applications must keep up. Cloud computing makes it easy for companies (like SalesForce, or Zynga) to deliver _seasonal_ iterations on their flagship software-as-a-service offerings. Millionairre-making  applications on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store often have a lifetime of weeks (or days!), not longer. In more stalwart organizations, we've seen departmental initaitves do end-runs around traditional IT and take advantage of self-service cloud computing technologies. Need to deploy an application that lives and dies as part of a marketing initiative? Something that's designed solely to support adhoc responses to emergencies? _Agility_ is as much about getting shippable code at launch as in subequent iteration.

### Prometheus's Microservice

It's not hard to see why a cloud-computing centric, horizontally scalable, agile approach to developing applications  like microservices would take hold against the backdrop of all these drivers! If anything, you might wonder why it's taken this long! It's hard to point to any one thing, but here's my _$0.02_: it _hasn't_. You see, microservices aren't all that new - the really big players (Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, eBay, Google, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Netflix, etc.) have all discovered or built the constituent parts to microservices by themselves. They had to, in order to survive and succeed. When you think of microservices, think of a set of patterns and practices  that fall out of building modern, distributed systems.

Enough organizations had to _discover_ these patterns before we - as a community - could distill them  and describe them. Many of these organizations have also open-sourced some of their work - or at least their ideas,   in the form of whitepapers. Where there was no credible (ideally open-source) solution, Pivotal has  filled in the gaps. If you take all these approaches and implementations together, you get what we think is the best microservice platform and stack out there. Let's take a look at what makes a  _Pivotal microservice_.




## A Pivotal Microservice is Agile

Today's applications need to be _agile_. As the markets move quickly, so too must boardroom direction translate into value in production. It's almost cliche /* TODO get accent for cliche*/ to bandy around the term _agile_ today, but that's because the alternative is almost unthinkable! I assure you, the likes of Twitter, Netflix, and Google are *not* using _waterfall_! An agile process informs technology because agile organizations must build code that is shippable, and code that can be developed in an iterable way.

### A Microservice Should be Singly-Focused
Adrian Cochroft /*TODO (sp and former title at Netflix?) */ described microservices as "SOA with a bounded context."  Microservices should be as tiny and focused as makes business sense.

Common sense applies. If a service might pose different scaling characteristics than the rest of the system and being able to independantly scale it would be helpful, consider factoring it out. If a service is evolved and extended at a different release cadence than the rest of the system, consider factoring it out. If a service is fundamentally better expressed using a different technology stack (and it is worth the network hop latency incurred to do so), consider factoring it out. I tend to approach service design in the same way that I approach object-oriented design: are there too many proverbial cooks in the kitchen? If so, factor the services out.

This architecture is reminiscent of the UNIX pipes 'n filters model  where singly-focused command line utilities like `cat`, `grep`, `find`, etc. can be composed into more useful chains of commands to deliver results. These command line utilities (the _filters_) communicate with each other using `stdin` and `stdout` (the _pipes_).

TIP: My pal Chris Richardson introduced me to some talks by Fred George wherein he describes his (.NET-centric) team's attempts to come to grips with microservices. His team ultimately decided, as rough guidance, that a microservice should be about 100 lines of code. His observation was that a service so small had some key benefits that encouraged agility. They're easy to throw away if there's a superior approach, easy to understand for newcomers, easy to test, easy to churn out, etc. I'm not sure if we should care all that much how _micro_ a microservice is. Instead, prefer services that are _singly focused_ or _bounded_. This encourages proper abstraction encapsulation, and yeilds most of the same benefits.

A service of that size is small enough that it doesn't matter what language or framework is used. After all, if it's decided at a later date to introduce new features, or to change the service, then it should be straightforward for anybody to understand what's going on. If the person assuming maintenance of that service is unfamiliar with the language or framework in which it's implemented, it's trivial to reimplement it. After all, it's just 100 lines of code, or so. A service that small, he observes, is so small that there's no risk in scrapping them and starting anew.


// todo ### a microservice is test-driven
// it should be easy to unit test code. very much in keeping w/ that philosophy, services should be developed to be as small and singly focused as possible. isolate covariants and keep them separate. spring's got amazing unit testing support. Talk about Jasmine, too.

### Easy from Inception to Production; Iteration is key
//  spring boot (start.spring.io), look how easy it is to get a working application up and running w/ Boot!
http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] is a marvelous choice for building microservices. Start at the http://start.spring.io[_Spring Initializr_] and then tick the boxes you want to get started with. For starters, I'd check _Web_, some sort of data persistence technology like _Mongo DB_ or _JPA_ and _Actuator_. I usually make sure to choose Java (and version 1.8) or Groovy. Leave the other selections as they are by default. Click _Generate_ and in a few seconds it will generate a `.zip` archive that contains a working, buildable Spring Boot-based application. If you leave the defaults selected, you'll be given a Maven project. You can  easily import it into the http://spring.io/tools/sts[Spring Tool Suite],  Intellij IDEA or Netbeans.

I've removed some of the (_very basic_) stuff that was pre-generated in the `.zip` archive. Reproduced below is the Java code.

.A complete, working REST service in `hello-world/src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}hello-world/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

<1> `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is the bit that turns on Spring Boot's magic
<2> this is a simple REST endpoint: all requests of any HTTP verb that hit `http://localhost:8080/hi/World` should yeild the response `Hello, World!`

To make this work, I needed to have a  Maven dependency on my `CLASSPATH`: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:{boot-version}`. This service takes advantage of Spring Boot's Maven plugin which makes running this service as simple as `mvn clean install && java -jar target/hello-world.jar`

Spring Boot is  a powerful way to do just about anything. If you want to dive further into some of its other capabilities, check out the http://spring.io/guides[guides].


### Agile Means Production Ready

Such a service, while trivial, demonstrates Spring Boot's productivity during development. However, as anyone whose read Michael Nygard's epic tome http://www.amazon.com/Release-It-Production-Ready-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213[_Release It!_] knows, being code-complete is not the same as being production-ready. There's a lot that goes into being ready to integrate with operations in production. Spring Boot aims to make being production ready as easy as possible by default. Agile adherants know, of course, that being production ready (having shippable code) after every sprint is a worthy goal, and Spring Boot is nothing if not _agile_.

Spring Boot provides the _actuator_ module which installs useful endpoints that expose information about the application. Add the Maven dependency `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator:{boot-version}` to the `CLASSPATH` and re-run the application. The actuator module installs endpoints over REST and JMX, for example. You might for example connect the `/health` endpoint - which gives you information about the health of the application - to your router and monitoring tools. You might use `/trace` to understand the traffic hitting the application. You might use `/env` to see the running service's environment - its environment variables, its system properties, etc.

.The `/health` endpoint. This will give you useful defaults for SQL database, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, SOLR, Redis, and more. You can also override it.

.The `/metrics` shows you interesting numbers - memory, requests made to endpoints, classes loaded, etc.
image::{images}metrics.png[]

.The `/trace` endpoint shows you all requests made to the application.
image::{images}trace.png[]

While it's easy enough to get a Spring Boot application up and running given a Java virtual machine, the devil, as they say, is often in the details. Taking this application to production involves describing which backing services (databases, message queues, etc.) are required (and where they live), how much RAM and other system resources it needs, on what host it should be exposed over, how many instances should run for capacity, and much more.

Fortunately, modern Platform-as-a-Service options like http://cloudfoundry.org[Cloud Foundry] make describing these things - and more -  trivial. Cloud Foundry is an open-source Apache 2 licensed project that Pivotal makes available through a hosted service  as  http://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services] and that Pivotal also sells as http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf[an on-premise PaaS offering called Pivotal Cloud Foundry].

Cloud Foundry applications can be configured through the `cf` CLI or through a `manfiest.yml` file that typically lives in the root of the deployed application. Here is a trivial `manfifest.yml` for the simple Spring Boot service we just created.



.This `manifest.yml` tells the PaaS what we need to run this application; how much RAM, which binary to run, which backing-services to run (though we've specified none here), the URI
[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}hello-world/manifest.yml[]
----

Moving the application to production is now as simple as `cf push` in the directory where the `manifest.yml` file lives.


## A Pivotal Microservice is Configurable

Let's distinguish the two types of configuration: application internal configuration and external configuration. Application internal configuration - such as the wiring of the components in the application - and external configuration - things that change from one environmnet to another.

Spring applications are _configured_ in that they're a grouing of objects (_beans_) wired together to build an application. This configuration is internal, and belongs in the Java language or XML configuration formats natively supported by Spring. Ideally, you'll need to perform very little of this and instead lean on the defaults provided by Spring Boot's _auto configuration_.



### Externalized Application Configuration

For external configuration _values_ - such as database authentication information  - use Spring's property placeholder resolution. The {12f}/config[12 Factor applications guidance on configuration] suggests that things that may change between deploys (such as as database authentication information between different deployment environments like _staging_, _production_, and a given user's _developer environment_) should be externalzed from the application.  Spring natively works with configuration values. It supports an `Environment` abstraction that reads property keys and values from numerous sources. As a running Spring Boot application you can read from this environment in many ways. In the example below, we demonstrate a few different ways to access values from the environment in Spring.


.Asking questions of the `Environment` in which a Spring application runs.
[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/external-configuration/src/main/java/configuration/external/Application.java[]
----

<1> This variable uses the  http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language] to dynamically resolve the `PATH` variable and then split it using the system's `path.separator` value. SpEL gives developers the ability to be a bit dynamic in resolving properties, though I'd prefer the `${..}` syntax for the common cases.
<2> This variable is simply _injected_ with the value of `path`, as resolved by talking to the `Environment` abstraction.
<3> Here too, the variable is simply _injected_ with the value of `path` as resolved by talking to the `Environment`.  If the property is not defined, then Spring will set the variable to the value `World`
<4> here, the `PATH` environment variable is resolved from the `Environment` abstraction directly

Spring Boot makes short work of reading and working with hierarchical YAML and standard `.properties`-file based property definitions. For example, you could define a file `configuration/external-configuration/src/main/resources/application.properties` file with a definition for a `name` property like so, and then re-run the application above.

.The definition of a `name` property in a `application.properties`
[source,properties]
-----
name=Spring Users
-----

You could also dereference other environment values, like this:

.Aliasing the property `name` to the value of the environment variable `USER` in  `src/main/resources/application.properties`
[source,properties]
-----
name=${env.USER}
-----

Spring Boot responds to numerous well-known properties as well. For example, if you're uising the default embedded container support (as we are in this example) then you can specify on which port the application should listen using the `server.port` property. If you specify a value of `0`, Spring Boot will attempt to pick a port for you. To see what other properties Spring Boot will respond to given the libraries on the `CLASSPATH`, add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator:{boot-version}` dependency to your CLASSPATH and then visit `/configprops`.

Spring  resolves properties from a chain of `PropertySource` s, each of which has a priority relative to others. Spring Boot takes this support further, and defines sources from an application's command-line arguments, the `java` process' `-D`-style arguments,  and shell environment variables. Spring Boot resolves values from the outer most contexts first. An environment variable takes precedecne over a `-D` argument which takes precedence over a property defined in an internal property file or `.yml` file. In the example above, we could leave our `application.properties` and - before running the example, define an environment variable `NAME` to override the value provided.

.Running the application with different arguments
[source,shell]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/external-configuration/run.sh[]
----

<1> the `server.port` property is _fuzzily_ resolved from the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable. As specified, Spring Boot will attempt to find and assign a port for the application, almost at random.
<2> the `name` property specified as `-Dname=Java` _overrides_ the property of the same name in the compiled `.jar` 's `application.properties`

### Cloud Foundry environment variables

Cloud Foundry externalizes all environment-specific configuration using environment variables  that Cloud Foundry makes available for every process. This is very much in keeping with the {12f}/config[12 Factor applications guidance on configuration]. It's wise not to count on these values remaining static. Don't cache them. If your application is restarted, or the server on which it is running  goes  down, Cloud Foundry will start the application on another node and the information may change. Ditto for the backing service authentication information. So, instead, prefer to consume these values through the environment and re-establish connections on application restart.

[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/cloud-configuration/src/main/java/configuration/cloud/Application.java[]
----

<1> This is a simple `@Bean` definition for a `javax.sql.DataSource`
<2>  The  `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable has a JSON structure with a JSON structure of the services available to this provisioned application. We can index into that JSON structure by following the JSON path to the value we want. Thus, `vcap.services.pivotal-ms-pgsql.credentials.uri` ultimately resolves to the `uri` attribute in this JSON structure stored as a value of the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable: `{ "pivotal-ms-pgsql" : { "credentials" : { "uri": "..."} } }`
<3> This bean  definition could potentially throw an `Exception` when trying to create the `URI`
<4> Here we're using Spring's `SimpleDriverDataSource` example to demonstrate what's going on here. However, you normally don't need to worry about definining `DataSource`s and - certainly - if you're going to provide a `DataSource` then consider wrapping it in a connection pool like Tomcat's database connection pool (which Spring Boot ships with, by default).
<5> When this application is started, Spring Boot will make sure that all beans of type `CommandLineRunner` are given a callback. In this case, all records from the database will be returned and written to `stdout`.
<6> This prints the environment value of the `name` property which, if unspecified, would default to `World`.

You may provide external configuration values for Cloud Foundry applications easily. Here is a Cloud Foundry `manifest.yml` for our application that - besides specifying which backing service our application should consume and how much system resources are needed to run it - specifies an environment variable (`NAME`) that overrides the `name` attribute.

[source,yml]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/cloud-configuration/manifest.yml[]
----

<1> In this example, we define extra environment variables. One is `DEBUG`, which Spring Boot will see and turn on various debug-specific features: it will print out all the auto-configurations that matched, turn on reloadable templates, and more. The next environment variable is simply a definition of the variable `NAME` which we saw earlier. Here, Spring Boot will print out `Hello, Cloud!` on the console instead of the default value `World`. You can see this output by running `cf logs cloud-configuration --recent`.


### The Spring Cloud Configuration Server
Thus far we've focused on the single-service case. Spring's configuration support works well here.

There are some drawbacks. Configuration updates require server pushes to change the configuration. There is no mechanism to support runtime configuration. In a production environment, it is important to be able to trace, or correllate, behavior at runtime to the configuration changes that preceded them. Configuration is, ideally, journaled; it should be easy to version and rollback configuration. Configuration  should be centralized, so that a change in one place can affect changes in multiple services in a repeatable way.

Spring Cloud provides a configuration server.  It makes available to other services the configuration that it reads (and proxies, in a way) from a Git repository. Git, naturally, is very capable of journaling configuration. Another service may act as a client to the configuration server.

Setting up the configuration server is easy.

.Standing up the configuration server is as easy as adding `@EnableConfigServer` on an otherwise basic Spring Boot application.
[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/config-server/src/main/java/configuration/server/Application.java[]
----

.The configuration server needs to know what server it's talking to. It expects you to define an attribute - `spring.cloud.config.server.uri` - that points to a Git repository. In this case, the repository lives on my `Desktop` but could just as easily live in GitHub or anywhere else. If you're referencing GitHub, just provide the repository page URI itself.
[source,properties]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/config-server/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

The rules are simple. The configuration server will make all configuration in the Git repository available to configuration server clients. Each configuration server client looks at the `spring.application.name` attribute (typically found in a file named `bootstrap.properties` or `bootstrap.yml`) and will get the configuration specific to that application. Thus, if a configuration client's `spring.application.name` is `config-client`, then the configuration server will return any configuration in `config-client.yml`, or `config-client.properties`, and of course the usual suspects (`application.properties` or `application.yml`, etc.).

Let's look at a trivial  client.  This client defines an object -`NameHolder` - that requires a configuration value - `name` - from the configuration server.

[source,java]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/config-client/src/main/java/configuration/client/Application.java[]
----

The client resolves which configuration to load from the configuration server in `bootstrap.properties` or `bootstrap.yml`.

[source,properties]
----
include::{code-root}configuration/config-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties[]
----


A service can force a refresh of the configuration it gets from the configuration server. In this way, each service _pulls_ configuration.


If you want to _push_ configuration, it's a snap to tie other services to the Spring Cloud event bus which uses RabbitMQ as its messaging fabric.
This setup sidesteps the need for the configuration serice to maintain  a list of hosts and ports to which configuration changes should be pushed. This quality is particularly valuable in a cloud environment where hosts and ports are ephemeral.

### Spring Cloud refreshable configuration




// ----------------------------------------------------------
## A Pivotal Microservice is Portable

A microservice should  be _portable_. Portability affects various layers of the microservice.  A microservice should ideally run on both a developer's local machine _and_ the production environment with a minimum of (ideally, external configuration-only) changes. This point is really well articulated in the  {12f}/dev-prod-parity[12-Factor manifesto's page on development and production parity]. An application with few-to-no gaps between development and production can be continuously deployed with more confidence. This is part of the _agile_ nature of a Pivotal microservice.

### Open services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Hadoop
The first, implied point here is that you should not use services that don't exist in both your local developer environment or your productione environment. An application written for  Cloud Foundry takes advantage of open, commodity backing services like http://postgresql.org[PostgreSQL], http://rabbitmq.org[RabbitMQ], and http://redis.io[Redis] so that developers can acheive parity  in local, staging and production environments without being tied to proprietary APIs like Amazon's SQS or Google App Engine's task queue.

### Use Spring Profiles to Move Between Environments

Spring's `Environment` abstraction - which we've already seen in action when asking questions of the application's environment - can also be partitioned along _profiles_. A It's easiest to think of a profile as a sort of label, or tag, that marks one bean, or configuration value, as belonging to a specific environment. You can _activate_ profiles readily. The easiest way is to define an environment variable, `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`, and set as its value one or more comma-delimited profile names, like: `cloud`. If you partition values appropriately and then activate appropriately, you can toggle different configuration sets.

Let's revisit our simple example from before. This time, we'll rework it ever so slightly so that there's a bit of indirection in specifying profiles. As such, this code will run perfectly on both our _local_ environment (or, rather, the `default` profile which is the active environment we get absent any specific profile) and in the cloud (Cloud Foundry).

.Running the application with different arguments
[source,shell]
----
include::{code-root}portable/src/main/java/portable/Application.java[]
----


You might for example define a set of configration values for  different environments. By default, Spring Boot will load configuration property files  of the form `application.properties` or `application.yml`. If there is an `application-PROFILE.properties` file, where `PROFILE` is the name of the active `profile`, Spring Boot will load the more specific configuration file, too.


.This configuration file (`application-default.properties`) will be activated when no other profile is activated (such as in a local environment).
[source,properties]
----
include::{code-root}portable/src/main/resources/application-default.properties[]
----

.This configuration file (`application-cloud.properties`) will be activated when the `cloud` profile is active.
[source,properties]
----
include::{code-root}portable/src/main/resources/application-cloud.properties[]
----

<1> Specifically, this will use the port specified by Cloud Foundry, and exposed to our process through the `vcap.application.port` property by Spring Boot
<2> Our PostgreSQL database connection URI will be resolved by dereferencing the URI exposed through the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

You can easily specify that your application should honor a specific profile by specifying the active profile using the well-known environment variable, `SPRING_ACTIVE_PROFILE`, be it through the `cf` CLI or a Cloud Foundry `manifest.yml`.

.A  `manifest.yml` file that sets the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to activate a specific profile when running on Cloud Foundry
[source,properties]
----
include::{code-root}portable/manifest.yml[]
----

From there, you need only run `cf push` to get the application to behave correctly in Cloud Foundry and you can as easily run the application locally, too.


### CloudFoundry is an Open PaaS
Applications that run on Cloud Foundry are, of course, not required to stay on Cloud Foundry. You might start your application on Pivotal's hosted, public, Cloud Foundry-based Pivotal Web Services, then decide to move things in-house on your own Cloud Foundry installation using Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Don't want to use either? Use any of the many Cloud Foundry-based services and products provided by ecosystem partners, like IBM's BlueMix. And, assuming you've exposed service configuratino as environment variables, there's no reason you couldn't run the application unchanged on another PaaS altogether.


## A Pivotal Microservice is Resilient to Failure
### PCF & heartbeat
### Spring Cloud & Hystrix
### Service Death Might just be the platform helping u out.
// after all, it could just be moving a node from one box to another in the case of an outage
//- light, resilient to failure, death (they should be easy to start, kill, at a moments notice); theyre quick to start, stop. can die  at a moments notice; no long running HTTP svcs. u can stop listening to http and refuse incoming requests; netflix chaos monkey; choregraphy vs orchestration (eg, react to failure per service)




## A Pivotal Microservice Should Play Well with Others
### Spring Cloud Eureka to handle service discocery
### using Spring Cloud SSO to secure service-to-service communication


## A Pivotal Microservice is Data-Driven
### XD makes crunching and managing data easy
### built on the shoulders of Spring Batch & Integration
### PHD & HAWK are awesome.

##  A Pivotal Microservice is Scalable
### Process -Centric Concurrency
### Basic PCF Auto-Scaling
### no Session State!
//systems should not rely on the service or session state associate w/ that service being around later. file system state shoudl be transactional in nature only (e.g, upload and process a file, then write to a MongoDB or something, )
// requires that applications behave accordingly: if u need HTTP session state, use Spring Session & Redis

## Conclusion

## Technology Glossary
// todo: find an introduction video to each of these technologies to link to in this glossary!
- http://redis.io[**Redis**] is an Apache 2 licensed distributed data-structure service that makes it a snap to get cluster-visible collections (like a `java.util.Map<K,V>` or a `java.util.Set<T>` or a `java.util.List<T`). It's commonly used for  caching, for example at Twitter.
- http://rabbitmq.com[**RabbitMQ**] is an Apache 2 licensed message queue that implements the open AMQP protocol. AMQP was defined by a working group of banks that needed highly available messaging that worked language- and platform-agnostic way. Because it's open-source, it works well with other AMQP brokers, though you won't often need that support as RabbitMQ is very capable. It provides full HA support,  transactional message production and consumption, and more. It is the most ubiquitous message queue in the cloud, surpassing even Amazon's own SQS in AWS deployments. It is used, for example, for the highly available chat system that powers the Huffington Post, and to scale the Indian  national identity service  that serves India's 1.2 billion people.
- http://cloudfoundry.org[**Cloud Foundry**] is an Apache 2 licensed Platform-as-a-Service that makes it easy to manage applications. It transparently provides services like routing, clustering, service-brokering, and scaling for the developer in a uniform way. It is used, for example, by Baidu, the world's 4th largest search engine (or 3rd, if you don't count Yahoo! which, after all, is powered by Bing these days).
